This repository comprises my solutions for the SQL exercises that are provided by the online course.

## Database Structures

The queries will run over small data sets conforming to the following schemas:
1) [Movie Rating Exercises Schema](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YDB-SQL0001+2T2020+type@asset+block/moviedata.html).
2) [Social Network Exercises Schema](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YDB-SQL0001+2T2020+type@asset+block/socialdata.html).
